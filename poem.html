    <h1>To My Love,</h1>
    <p class="pea">
        It seems crazy to me that only a year has past since we've first met. Yet still it feels like yesterday,
        I remember sitting across from you at Shiso, knowing I wanted you. I loved you from your lips to your hips,
        (totally not cringe) and I started to fall inlove with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has been quite a journy along the way, from Mukwah way out west to Edmonton to The Stampede and many Skip
        adventures,
        we seem to enjoy drives together. I had never actually noticed that till now, but we actually do some pretty
        cool stuff together. And ofc our planned trip to America will have us on the road together again.
    </p>
    <p>
        I know we have had our rough patches, but we've always gotten through them together, and I belive we both
        come out stronger on the other side. We always come to have an understanding of eachother, and we try to
        talk it out afterwards when emotions run out. And I really think that has to count for something.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyways, what thats all trying to say is I love you. A lot. Theres nothing I'm exited for more then to
        share a hotel with just you and have a little escape for our anniversery. I LOVE YOU!
    </p>
